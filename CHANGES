# v0.2.21 2021-06-08

- New metrics:
  - plantpower: deployed power in renewable energy plants

# v0.2.20 2021-05-25

- City level maps for local groups (filter by local group)
  - Just Baix Montseny and Baix Llobregat available.

# v0.2.19 2021-03-26

- Numeric data in TSV format with query param `format=tsv`
- Legacy API v0.1 has been dropped (TSV was the only reason to keep it)
- Date semantic change: measures are taken at the begining of
  the date, not at the end, so that events during the date
  are not included.
  This makes year and month aggregation more consistent.
  Yearly aggregated 2021-01-01 will contain all events in 2020
  but none in 2021.
- Map API errors are issued as SVG images
- Numeric API errors as YAML, not JSON to match success format
