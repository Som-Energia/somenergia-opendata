metrics:
- id: members
  text: Members
  description: |
    Current cooperative members at the start of a given date.

    Members are taken from our current ERP data, so the following considerations apply:
    - Membership during the first months of the cooperative was stored in spreadsheets and is not included yet.
    - There is no historical record of member addresses. So, if a member has changed her home from Vigo to Cartagena, it counts as she has been living all the time in Cartagena.
    - Only a single start date can be stored so, canceled and later renewed memberships are not properly recorded.
