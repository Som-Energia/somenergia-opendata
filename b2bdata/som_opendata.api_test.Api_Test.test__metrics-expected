- id: members
  text: Members
  description: 'Current cooperative members at the start of a given date.


    Members are taken from our current ERP data, so the following considerations apply:

    - Membership during the first months of the cooperative was stored in spreadsheets
    and is not included yet.

    - There is no historical record of member addresses. So, if a member has changed
    her home from Vigo to Cartagena, it counts as she has been been living all the
    time in Cartagena.

    - Only a single start date can be stored so, canceled and later renewed memberships
    are not properly recorded.

- id: contracts

- id: selfconsumptioncontracts
  text: Self-consumption contracts
  description: 'Active contracts with selfconsumption just before the date.


    Considerations:


    - This metric is obtained from data in the ATR system.

    - Once self-consumption is activated for a contract, we are not accounting later
    modifications disabling it.

    It will be considered self-consumption until the end of the contract.
